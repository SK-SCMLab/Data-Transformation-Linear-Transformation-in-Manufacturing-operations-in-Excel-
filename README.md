This repository contains simple case studies in Excel demonstrating the use of data and linear transformation techniques to clean, prepare and analyze manufacturing data for process improvement

### ðŸ˜ƒ Data Transformation
Data transformation involves changing the format, structure, or values of data to make it suitable for analysis, modeling, or control. It is crucial in manufacturing to:
- Normalize or standardize measurements across resources
- Convert units (e.g. tons to kilograms)
- Handle non-linearity in sensor data
- Identify hidden trends or prepare data for statistical models
Generally, normally distributed data is preferred in order to use a no. of statisical tools like:
- Individual value control charts
- Capability analysis
- T-Tests
- ANOVA
When data is not normally distributed, the cause for non-normality should be determined and appropriate remedial actions should be taken
